== About

This project has three functions. They are in the left menu. The import function reads coordinate data sets from text files and print these coordinates to google maps. The Reduction function sends all coordinate data to server and waits response. When the response came prints new coordinates to google maps. The new coordinates' colors are green. The Search function sends data which is chosen by user - all coordinates or reduced coordinates list - and top left and bottom right coordinates of rectangle  to server and  waits response. When the response came prints new coordinates and draws the searching rectangle to google maps. The found coordinates' colors are rose.The searching rectangle's color is yellow.
